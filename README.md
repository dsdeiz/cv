# My LaTeX CV

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dsdeiz/cv.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/dsdeiz/cv)

Template is from [Professional CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/professional-cv).

To build, install [MacTex](https://tug.org/mactex/) first &mdash; `brew cask install mactex`.

**Note:** You can also install [Basic Tex](https://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html) but you will need to deal with manually grabbing the dependencies.

Run `make` to generate the output and `make clean` to clean it up.
